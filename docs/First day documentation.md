first they have two ways of working in the main time 8/22/2025 there are no api for work with,
so we can only work with FTP so we set the files of our data then they put a new file for orders or...etc.
it work on three stages:
1-create offers on existing orders:
the first way is we have exisiting products (even they are belong to us or for any one)
then we can create an offer on them so we can change the price the shippment method or any thing avalibale on the website, then we publish it to get the orders with at least the minimum requiremnts.
2- activate product creation:
after we set a file that contains the offer, they review the files and apply the offers and publish it to the market to get thee orders from the customers. and if there is a problem they made a file with advices and problems to help us and they send the details using this email pdi@digitecgalaxus.ch .
3- now after publish we should edit the details to ensure that we making sales.

the conclusion of first day:
I knew that we work with files structure that we have some fixed structure for each stage,
and also they some rules for the files content like columns and data,
I can find it in Stage 1 file structure 
and also we have some Images and files that help me to see how should my code take the products and set it and the offers and the media,

remain read from Stage3.
