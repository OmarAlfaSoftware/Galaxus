this file contains how the data structued in stage 1 to start integrate with the company.
these Images are related to Stage 1:
1- In the excel we cant repeat columns or set spaces or new line like this Image [header]("../Images/Stage 1/column headers example.png")
2- When Converting from CSV to EXCEL we should take care about number because it maybe look like this [ISSUE]("../Images/Stage 1/convert from csv to excel issue.png")
3- when write a GTIN or number it maybe contain leading Zeroes so the excel will ignore them so need to tak care about it [Numbers]("../Images/Stage 1/leading zeroes in cells.png")
4- we should not set empty lines in the sheet [emptyLines]("../Images/Stage 1//no empty lines.png")
5- we should make the excel file contain only one tab(sheet) because any other tabs will be ignored [Tabs]("../Images/no other tabs.png")
6- we should ensure the number are written in right format like this [Format]("../Images/Stage 1/number in excel must be in this format.png")
7- there are possibles of files structure in stage one like this [structure]("../Images/Stage 1/Possible files structure in stage 1.png")


first we have the offers:-
to push an offer so we make a file contain at least:
1- item number.
2- price.
3- stock.
4- EAN/GTIN.

and for activate the products on the website we must create a file:
1- product data
2- price
3- stock
and better to divide them into three files like image in [Image]("'../Images/Stage 1/Possible files sructure in stage 1.png'")


ASSORTMENT FILE:
the most Important file in the structure
because it control wich products are considered as active products and available on the market for sale or the MP.
also if any products is have stock 0 or unavailable its better to remove his product from the file.
Only Products in this file will uploaded and be Available.

Stock Handle:
if a product has stock of 0, we can do either set the time that the item will be available again or the date (NOT_BOTH).
or we just can set the Date to zero and its equal to none or not determined time for recharge.


MOQ (Minumum order quantity):
this helping in shipping as there are some products can't shipped alone or small number so we set the minimum number of products that must be orderd to accept the order.
if the MOQ is not setted its by default take value of 1


OQS (Orders Qunatity Steps):
its mean that if this product can't be shipping in any number like 2 or 3 or 4 
no it must be a number that fit the shipping package like cooking items or cups like it must be 6 in the package so the order must be 6 or 12 or 18 and so on.


GTIN:
to get GTIN for the product we must sign the Company in GS1 website to get the company number,
then we set each products align with the company number like if the company number equal to 123456 and my product ID = 10 so the GTIN = 123456000010.


STRUCTURES:

DATA Format

| **Type**                       | **CSV-Standard**                | **XLSX-Standard**                | **Exception/ Remark / Example**   |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **File format**                 | CSV / TXT                       | XLSX                             | Other formats possible in consultation but not recommended |
| **File name**                   | File names for initial configuration - without spaces / special characters / umlaut. <br> File names for file updates - the files **must be replaced** by the old files for each transmission and **have exactly the same file names** as the previous ones. | Examples: <br> ProductData_DigitecGalaxus.csv <br> PriceData_DigitecGalaxus.xlsx |                                   |
| **Character coding**            | UTF-8                           | -                                | Other character codes possible in consultation but not recommended |
| **Separator**                   | **;** (Semicolon)               | -                                | Other limit signs possible in consultation |
| **Header**                       | Header with column designation is mandatory | Header with column designation is mandatory | Duplicates are not allowed for column names. Column name must be present. Column names must not contain line breaks. |
| **Decimals**                    | Decimal places must be separated with a **.** (dot) or **,** (comma). <br> Example - VatRatePercentage: 8.1 <br> Thousands separators are not allowed: 1000 or 1,00 | -                                | Comma must not be used if the separator in the CSV is also a comma. |
| **Text / Parsing**              | Strings (data type: text) must be enclosed in inverted commas ("). | -                                | In the case of descriptions and product data, it is particularly important that these are enclosed in inverted commas because they can contain the characters that also act as separators (semicolon, comma, pipe) and/or line breaks which, if unmasked, prevent the import. Example: LongDescription_en: "TV with size 46"" and stand with white label ""Kings of E-Commerce"" |
| **Structure**                   | The structuring of the data within the text file must be observed. | The data to be read in is in the first sheet tab and there are no hidden sheet tabs. <br> Completely empty lines or notes in the file should be avoided if possible. | Example XLSX - Multiple worksheets |
| **Scientific notations**        | Scientific notations are not allowed | -                                | Often CSV files are opened and saved in Excel. This process changes the structure of the numbers contained in the file. Information such as GTIN, item number and others become unusable as a result. |
| **Number format**               | -                               | Cells with numeric values may only be in standard or number format. Other formats, such as accounting or user-defined, are not allowed. <br> Excel deletes leading zeros from numbers, which can lead to problems, especially with article numbers or GTINs. In such a case, the partner should format the affected column as text. | Example - number formats |
| **Date**                         | Option 1: YYYY-MM-DD           | Option 2: DD.MM.YYYY            | One-digit days/months must be supplemented with a leading zero, e.g. 2020-07-01 or 01.07.2020. <br> Separators are to be used according to the formats. |

(RestockDate - today). National holidays do not have to be considered. <br> *Maximum value = 365* <br> If the value 0 (days) is transmitted, we interpret it the same way as if no value were transmitted. <br> Either RestockTime OR RestockDate is possible - not both. <br> RestockTime or RestockDate are considered only if the quantity on stock is equal to 0. In case of a positive stock quantity, restocktime or restockdate are ignored. |

In case of a positive stock quantity, restocktime or restockdate are ignored. |

This information is relevant for assortments with several warehouses and different delivery times. <br> *Standard ISO 3166-2 Country code* <br> For marketplace traders, we do not currently offer this specification. |
| **WarehouseId**            | Str(50)       | Warehouse identification number     | The identification number of the warehouse. This information is relevant for assortments with multiple warehouses located in the same country. <br> *Global Location Number (GLN) | GS1 Switzerland*.
