|---|---|---|
| ProviderKey appears multiple times in file! | There are several identical rows in the file. These rows have identical provider keys and identical product data; pricing data; stock data and media data.<br><br>Identical article (whole row incl. ProviderKey) occurs several times in the file<br><br>Data row with affected article occurs several times. However, the data rows are not identical. | Please check both the validation log and your file. As soon as you find the duplicate ProviderKey (your item no.) in your file, please remove the whole line(s), so that you are left with unique lines with unique ProviderKey's only.<br><br>Please check the validation log thoroughly and look for the mentioned duplicate ProviderKey (your Art-No.) in the affected rows. Then check if the supplied data is correct and if it is possible to give each row a unique ProviderKey. |
| Provided value contains following disallowed characters: {invalidChars} | The provider key is present in the file, but you are still getting this error message. Other data is also present alongside the provider key. | This error usually happens when a letter/symbol in the provider key is not within the ASCII 32-126 format. Hence, our system cannot validate the value of the provider key and therefore it returns a validation error for the entire row.<br><br>Some examples of characters that are not allowed: umlaut characters - ä, ö, ü, letters such as č, š, đ, ø, ñ or Cyrillic, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic script and similar.<br><br>Please correct the provider key with letters/symbols from the ASCII 32-126 Format.

The hidden rows in excel will sometimes turn into import errors in the case that the excel file is converted into a csv file, as the hidden rows might ruin the parsing of the file.<br><br>If you have rows, which have no specification keys (but have specification values and provider keys) in them, please fill the keys in or remove these rows from the file, as they will cause validation errors.<br><br>Please fill in the missing provider key value into the affected row or delete the row, until you have a ready to use provider key. |
| No values except ProvideyKey provided | The affected row has only a provider key, while other data is missing. | Please fill in the rest of the missing data or remove the whole row if there is no other data. Other data besides the ProviderKey can be added.<br><br>Example of a file with validation errors:<br>`ProviderKey;SpecificationKey;SpecificationValue`<br>`ProviderKeyA;Color;Red → No error`<br>`ProviderKeyC;;Blue → validation error` |
| The parsed value must not exceed 200 characters. | Specification key exceeds 200 characters. | Please check if the specification key has more than 200 characters and if yes, please trim the value down, as the value will get ignored, if it above 200 characters.
